# Data Analysis on Time Tracker Data of University Employees
(STAT 6430 , SAS Project - Jul 2018)

This project contains code in SAS 

#### About the project 

#### Background:
A university runs a consulting center called the Analytical Consulting Lab for small- to
moderate-sized consulting projects within the university. There are three consultants who
meet with clients, offer advice, and possibly help analyze data, help plan and implement
a research study, or help develop resources. The last names of these three consultants are
Smith, Jones, and Brown. There is also a Lab Coordinator (LC) who assigns incoming
projects to the consultants and tracks the time the consultants spend on each project.
Each work day, each consultant tracks the amount of time spent working on each project
and submits this information to the LC on a form (one per project). On this form, the
consultants specify the date, the total number of hours (rounded to 15 minutes) spent on
the project during the day, the project number, the project stage, and whether the project
has been completed.
The LC has recently been experimenting with project classifications, which designate an
entire project as one of four types:
* 1. Study coordination
* 2. Information technology and web development
* 3. Data analysis
* 4. Advising

The following objectives were achieved in this project -

##### Objective 1:
Create a new master file that is completely up to date, error-free, and includes the project
classication types.

##### Objective 2:
Starting with the new master file, generate a report of ongoing projects as of the last entry
date (November 4th). Ongoing projects are those that have not yet been completed. This
report should show only project numbers.

##### Objective 3:
Starting with the new master file, generate a report of the consulting activity of each consul-
tant on each project as of the last entry date (November 4th). There should be three separate
reports, each showing the project numbers on which the consultant has worked. For each
project the following information should be given: the total number of hours worked, the
project type, whether the project has been completed, the start date of the project, and the
end date of the project (determined by the last form submitted for the project).

##### Objective 4:
Starting with the new master file, generate one (or more) additional report that you think
offers useful information to the LC. This report should summarize the data in some meaning-
ful way and should make use of a PROC procedure other than PROC PRINT (and PROC
SQL). Graphical reports are acceptable, but not required.
